Actions are events that fires at a specific moment on the application process. 
The idea behind this is to dispatch an alert to whatever is interested on that alert so that it execute a specific action. 

Mainly, Hook are made to value to be mutated. In that case, we're talking about "Filters" (rather than action). In order hands "Actions" doesn't transform the provided 
value (unless it's an object).
